Objective Function: Minimize ROI(h) subjected to the constraints.

Where:

    ROI(h) = Total Investment / Total Profit
    Total Investment = C_material + C_construction
    Total Profit = Annual Revenue - Annual Operational Cost

Subject to the constraints:

    Geometry of the Cooling Tower:

    D1 (diameter at the bottom) = 50 + 0.5 * h
    D2 (diameter at the top) = 30 + 0.25 * h
    A (surface area of the tower) = π * (D1 + D2) * sqrt((D1 - D2)^2 / 4 + h^2)

    Cost of Materials and Construction:

    C_material (cost of materials) = k_material * A
    C_construction (cost of construction) = k_construction * h

    Temperature at height h:

    T_air_h (ambient temperature at the height h) = T_ambient + h² * gradient_air

    Heat Transfer Coefficient:

    hc = a * v + b

    Actual Heat Transfer:

    Q_actual = hc * A * (T_water - T_air_h)

    Annual Revenue:

    revenue_per_year = Q_actual * cost_per_MW

    Annual Operational Cost:

    C_operation_per_year = Some predefined value or function

    Total Profit:

    total_profit_per_year = revenue_per_year - C_operation_per_year
